An algorithm that selects the largest value in a list of numbers

Step 1: set first
Step 2: set second
Step 3: set third
Step 4: set i = 0
Step 5: set Afirst, Asecond and Athird
STep 6: While(Position = i+1)
Step 7: If Asecond>Afirst, then compare Athird with Asecond
Step 8: else 
Step 9: If Asecond<Afirst, then compare Athird with Afirst
Step 10: End of loop
Step 11: Print final number
Step 12: Stop
